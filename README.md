## Project Overview:
This project involves developing a native iOS application using Swift and SwiftUI that allows users to search for stock symbols/tickers and view detailed information about them. The app enables users to trade with virtual money, manage a portfolio, and favorite stock symbols for tracking. The application includes two main screens: the Home screen and the Detailed Stock Information screen, each featuring multiple functionalities.

## Objectives:

	•	Gain familiarity with Swift language, Xcode, and iOS app development.
	•	Learn and implement the latest SwiftUI framework.
	•	Practice the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) design pattern.
	•	Build a visually appealing native iOS app with deep integration of native functionalities provided by Apple.
	•	Utilize the Finnhub APIs for financial data.
	•	Manage and integrate third-party libraries through Swift Package Manager.

## Features:

	1.	Home Screen:
  	•	Search for stock symbols/tickers.
  	•	View a list of stock symbols with autocomplete suggestions.
  	•	Favorite stock symbols for easy tracking.

	2.	Detailed Stock Information Screen:
  	•	Display detailed information about selected stocks, including company profile, stock quotes, recommendation trends, company peers, and company earnings.
  	•	View hourly and historical chart data points.
  	•	Trade stocks with virtual money.
  	•	Manage portfolio including viewing current holdings and cash balance.
  	•	Fetch and display relevant data using API calls.

## Technologies Used:

	•	Programming Languages: Swift
	•	Frameworks: SwiftUI
	•	Design Pattern: Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM)
	•	APIs: Finnhub API (via Node.js)
	•	Backend: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB
	•	Libraries: Managed through Swift Package Manager
	•	Development Environment: Xcode

## API Integrations:

	•	Finnhub APIs: Used for retrieving financial data such as company profiles, stock quotes, symbol autocomplete, stock news, recommendation trends, social sentiments, company peers, company earnings, hourly chart data points, and historical chart data points.
	•	MongoDB: Used for managing user data related to favorites, portfolio, and cash balance.

## Outcome:
The project will result in a fully functional native iOS application that provides users with comprehensive stock market information, allowing them to trade virtually and manage their portfolio effectively. This app will showcase the integration of various technologies and frameworks, demonstrating proficiency in iOS app development and API management.
